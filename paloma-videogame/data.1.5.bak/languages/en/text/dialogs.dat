They are hiding in a

the Solarus Amulet, the

is kept safe inside

The relic's owner has
the ability to summon
the Solarus power to
seal an object, a
place or even a world,
as the seven sages once
did when they sealed
away the Golden Land.
Zelda is the heiress of
that power. She used it
to seal the Triforce
shards, using the eight
beings created by the
Solarus.
Thus, as long as she
alone knows the secret
of the relic, she alone
masters the Triforce's
seal. This is why you
must protect the seal.
